# DoomRooms
a mod by Brownizzz for doom based on the Backrooms (mostly on the wikidot: http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/ ). If you want to help me for idk reasons or to chat about this project, my discord: brownizzz #BrownizzzTheBrownie (A server will be made later, maybe when Level 0 will be finished maybe not) => https://discord.gg/XXXXXXXXXX

#Setup
- Get GZDoom (from official website: https://zdoom.org/downloads, or from the github: https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/releases)
- Get Doom 2 wad from Steam, or get Freedoom 2 if you don't want to buy: https://freedoom.github.io/download.html (put the .wad file in the same folder as gzdoom.exe)
- Download the file as a zip (click code, then download zip)
- Drag and drop the zip to gzdoom.exe to run the mod or you can use a launcher (for exemple ZDL...)

#Goal for now
- Finish the Intro maps + the 9 first Backrooms level with their subs-level => uncomplete
- Do the basic entiies => basic smiler for now with no a proper behavior
- Implement a basic sanity bar => base finished with item n°1 - Almond Water 
- Make a PDA (idk how, for now I remove PDA until I figured out how to make my own)
